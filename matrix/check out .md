Ah! Got it, Swathi. üòé You want **strategic preparation based on ‚ÄúMaximum Sum Rectangle in a 2D Matrix‚Äù**, not just solving one problem. Let‚Äôs analyze carefully.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Pattern in ‚ÄúMaximum Sum Rectangle in a 2D Matrix‚Äù

This problem is essentially about **finding a submatrix with the maximum sum**.

Key things to notice:

* It's a **2D extension of the ‚ÄúMaximum Subarray Sum‚Äù problem** (Kadane‚Äôs algorithm).
* It involves **prefix sums** or **fixing two rows/columns** and applying 1D Kadane.
* Companies often ask variants that test:

  * **Row-wise / column-wise sum calculations**
  * **Sliding window on rows or columns**
  * **Dynamic Programming in 2D**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Categories of Questions Likely to be Asked

If a company is asking **Maximum Sum Rectangle**, these are related **matrix patterns** they may test this year:

### A) **Sum / Submatrix Related**

1. **Maximum sum rectangle in 2D** ‚Üí original problem.
2. **Maximum sum square of size k √ó k**.
3. **Maximum sum submatrix with constraints** (like sum ‚â§ K).
4. **Cumulative / prefix sum based problems**:

   * Sum of all submatrices
   * Sum queries for given submatrix coordinates

### B) **Row/Column Transformation / Kadane Variants**

1. Maximum sum **subarray in each row or column**.
2. Maximum sum **after flipping 0 ‚Üí 1 or 1 ‚Üí -1** (like binary matrix questions).

### C) **Pattern / Shape Based**

1. **L-shaped or T-shaped sums** in the matrix.
2. **Square of maximum size with all 1s** (classic ‚Äúlargest square of 1s‚Äù).
3. **Rectangle of all 1s** ‚Üí largest area rectangle problem.

### D) **Traversal Variants**

1. **Spiral order / snake order / diagonal traversal** ‚Üí they may combine traversal + sum.
2. **Zigzag traversal + maximum sum**.

### E) **Dynamic Programming in 2D**

1. **Minimum path sum from top-left to bottom-right**.
2. **Unique paths / paths with obstacles**.
3. **Submatrix sum with maximum/minimum product**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Skills You Should Focus On

If you want to **crack 2D matrix questions**, focus on:

1. **Prefix sum / cumulative sum in 2D** ‚Üí O(n¬≤) precomputation.
2. **Kadane‚Äôs algorithm in 1D** ‚Üí and how to extend it to 2D.
3. **Matrix traversal techniques**:

   * Spiral
   * Snake
   * Diagonal
   * Row/column-wise
4. **Shape-based questions**: largest square, largest rectangle, L-shape sum.
5. **Optimizations**: Avoid brute-force O(n‚Å¥) solutions; convert them to O(n¬≥) using 1D reductions.
